## Description

The goal was to build the backend of a simple Mongoose app to track workouts.
The app allows users to track both cardio and resistance workouts and view stats on those. 
This project gave me great practice using Mongoose. I feel very comfortable with aggregation now. These efforts can be seen in the dashboard tab of the app.
