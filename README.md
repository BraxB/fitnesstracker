## Description

The goal was to build the backend of a simple Mongoose app to track workouts.
The app allows users to track both cardio and resistance workouts and view stats on those. 
This project gave me great practice using Mongoose and I feel very comfortable using aggregation in Mongoose from this experience. These efforts can be seen in the dashboard tab of the app.
